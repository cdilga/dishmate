## Current Task: Implement an MVP set of decision trees to make dishmate work

Implement the spec in MVP_IDEA.md

Implementation status is tracked in .ralph/EPHEMERAL_STATUS.md
Choose a logical amount of work to complete. Ensure the write tests -> build implementation -> pass tests loop is followed
Choose property and unit tests as are appropriate

Add any extra logical flows (define them appropriately, in their tree structure) to flesh out the MVP for the dishmate.
Don't be afraid to do extra research.

### Important
- Follow the spec losely
- Commit after each phase or logical chunk of work
- Given you're in a loop, make a logical amount of progress per iteration
- Only report RALPH_DONE_SECRET when all phases are complete, and there are no workarounds or skipped tests left

### End result

This will be an MVP, we may use for a bit, and recalibrate thereafter. Focus on the most important value prop and the conversion pipeline. 

Commit and push before finishing.
Create gh repo, and push to main (or PR) when ready.
